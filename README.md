# TheGameingRoom

1.) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game producer who wanted to release a successful riddle game onto other platforms. The client wanted us to develop an online version similar to the mobile app.

2.) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I provided a strong suggestion for the application to take advantage of cloud services to have a more flexible and easy to maintain game.

3.) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most helpful peice of the design document for me was the section examining the well-known operating systems.

4.) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part that I would improve on would be the reccommeded section. The way that I would improve it would be to go into more detail on why I would reccommed it over the other options.

5.) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs as though they had the gamer's needs in mind and that they wanted the best experience for the fanbase. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing as the primary objective for developers is the user's enjoyment and satifaction in the product.
